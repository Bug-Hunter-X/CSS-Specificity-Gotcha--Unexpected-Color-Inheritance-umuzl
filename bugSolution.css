The solution involves using more specific selectors to override the less specific ones:

```css
div {
  color: blue;
}

p {
  color: red;
}

div p {
  color: green !important; /*Added !important to ensure overriding*/
}
```

Adding `!important` ensures that the `div p` selector overrides any other styles.  However, overuse of `!important` should be avoided as it can make CSS harder to maintain. A better solution would be to adjust the selectors to ensure correct specificity without relying on `!important`.

For example, if you are sure that the paragraph will only be within a div with a specific id, then you can add that in selector, increasing the specificity enough to override the general paragraph selector.
